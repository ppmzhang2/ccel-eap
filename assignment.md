## Week 1-01

### Reading

Before you read the text below, think about these questions.

1. What do you want to study at university? Why? / What are you studying? Why?
2. What do you think a university is?
3. What do you expect from a university?

Now read the passage, "What Is a University?" and answer the questions that
follow.

**What Is a University?**

Why am I here?
On campus, studying?
What's it all about?
What's it all for?

Perhaps these are some of the questions you have been asking yourself as you
make your way to your weekly lectures.
After all, universities can be daunting.
They are geographically large, and populated by a multicultural multitude of
students and staff.
It is easy to lose your way, both geographically and academically.

Many students consider university a stepping stone to a good job that will pay
a high salary, provide a comfortable and secure lifestyle, and perhaps gain
them some social status.
Doing a law degree is a prerequisite to becoming a lawyer.
An accounting degree is essential if you want to become an accountant.
Studying medicine will enable you to qualify as a doctor.
You need the degree to get these kinds of jobs.
In short, a university is a place for gaining knowledge for professional
development.

Another view on the subject is that university is not just a place where a
transfer of knowledge on particular subjects occurs, but a place to challenge
yourself.
A university course entails learning to question beliefs and to think
productively.

Your studies will require you to do research and investigate arguments,
evaluate ideas and comment appropriately in discussion and in writing.
The university environment will encourage you to think freely and independently
and to take responsibility for your own learning process.
Hopefully, your experience inspires life-long learning.

The importance of the social aspect of university life should not be
underestimated.
A university is unique in that your peers could be from any cultural and social
background and even from a different generation from you.
Everyone is starting from the same place, learning on the same level together.
Making friends with fellow students from different countries and demographics
develops social and cultural awareness.
Joining clubs and activities on campus provides opportunities for
self-development and social networking.
Social interaction encourages a democratic and inclusive ethos.

Embarking on a university degree is both exciting and challenging.
Understanding why you are studying and the many opportunities student life has
to offer will enable you to receive subject knowledge, think critically and
make friends with some amazing and inspiring people.

### Reading

1. Read the article 'Academic Language' and complete the guidelines for writing in
   academic English.
2. Write at least three do's and three don'ts in the table.

**Academic Language**

Academic language is the vocabulary and sentence structures used in texts,
assignment preparation and instructions.
Academic language is used in written form in classrooms and in the workplace.
Academic wording is also used in oral communication.
We use it to participate in discussion, in debate, in meetings at work and when
giving formal presentations.
Students not only need to understand the meaning of academic vocabulary, they
should be able to apply it accurately in both spoken and written situations.
A good understanding of academic language leads to success at university and in
a professional career.
Students who have difficulty understanding and using academic language will
find it difficult to study and may even decide to drop out.

Academic language uses more sophisticated vocabulary and complex sentence
structure.
To begin being able to recognise and use academic language, look at the
following explanation and examples.

The technical vocabulary that is part of your area of study is included in the
definition of academic vocabulary.
Transitions, or signposting language, used in essays is academic language.
Some examples include 'however', 'moreover "in addition' and 'to conclude'.
Language used to write instructions is academic.
Words such as discuss', 'analyse, 'complete' and submit' are good examples of
instructional language.

The use of slang or everyday conversational language is generally not
appropriate in academic writing.
Slang refers to very informal words or phrases used in conversation by
particular groups of people.
Examples in Australian English include 'uni', meaning university; "polly',
meaning politician; and journo', meaning journalist.
Everyday conversation uses words or phrases that are not used in formal speech
or writing, including phrasal verbs.
Sentences such as "I can't stand this hot weather!', 'How much longer do we
have to put up with it?', and Wadaya gonna do about ya job?' are all examples
of everyday conversational language that would not be appropriate in academic
writing or a formal presentation.
Finally, avoid clich√©s, or overused expressions, such as 'every coin has two
sides', face the facts' or times have changed'.

Remember to write full, grammatically correct sentences.
This includes not using shortened forms of words.
Write 'it is', not 'it's"; 'cannot', not 'can't' or 'can not'.
Spelling words correctly is essential.
Punctuation too should be correct.
Avoid abbreviations: for example, e.g should be written as 'for example'.
Keep the tone of your writing objective by avoiding the use of personal
pronouns such as 'l'.
Remain neutral by avoiding emotional language.

The sentence, 'I was extremely upset by the stupid decision the government
made' would be better written as, The absurd decision the government made was
offensive'.

Academic language is objective and formal.
Increase your knowledge of academic language by reading widely and recognising
words.
Remember the words and gradually incorporate them in your own writing and
discussion.
