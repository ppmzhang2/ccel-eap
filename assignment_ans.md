Online study enables students to develop knowledge and skills in various places
such as hotels, airport, etc., and it has been adopted in almost all stages of
education during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Compared to studying at school face to face, however, it has its difficulties
which students should not underestimate.

Learning online may not be as efficient as in a real physical classroom.
Without dedicated working environments, students studying online, as remote
workers, can be easily distracted from their tasks by chatting, childcare or
television.

Not all the teaching methods can be conveyed through the network.
The contemporary internet, however convenient it may be, cannot bring online
all the educational resources, such as laboratory equipment and experiment
materials.

Online education is merely a tool of knowledge transfer on particular subjects.
It lacks social interaction such as clubs and activities on campus, and cannot
provide students opportunities for self-development and social networking.
