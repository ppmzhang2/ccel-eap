## Week 1-2

### Writing 

Choose your favourite piece of technology.
Write a description of it giving a definition, stating its functions, the
reasons why you like it and its importance in your life.
You should write between 150 and 180 words and have 30 minutes to complete this

A tablet has been widely accepted as a personal necessity since its
introduction in 2010 as a multipurpose touch screen mobile instrument.
It has gained its prevalence by occupying a unique niche among various
electronic devices as a new balance between performance and mobility and can
serve both as an entertainment device and a productivity tool.
A usual tablet, such as a 10-inch iPad, is light enough to be brought anywhere
along with a cellphone yet carrying a far more capable chip that enables
performance-demanding games.
From a professional's perspective, numerous daily tasks can be easily handled
using a tablet, from word processing to video editing to joining conference
meetings, without requiring a PC or other cumbersome equipment.
These are just a few examples showing the success of a tablet, which is favored
by modern picky users from various backgrounds who see it as a promising relief
from restraints brought by outdated technology of the last century.

**A Report on Banning Mobiles on the Campus**

**Introduction**

This report examines the benefits and potential problems of banning mobile
phones in college.
In order to achieve this purpose, we investigated by interviewing a random
sample of both teachers and students.

**Benefits**

Many respondents believed that a total ban on cellphones on campus could
effectively reduce handset theft and improve security.
Some of the faculty and staff supported this planned prohibition and stated
that smartphones and their applications could be distracting, especially in the
classroom.

**Potential Problems**

This potential ban, however, has caused severe unease among most students
surveyed, and the main concern is whether or not the board has the power to
regulate a college student's private property.
As some of the interviewees mentioned, the right of the students to carry cell
phones or other electronic devices shall not be infringed, as long as such
devices do not disrupt college activity.

**Recommendations**

It was widely believed that restricting cell phone usage could help reduce
phone theft;
it is still, however, a highly controversial action, especially among students.
I would therefore recommend focusing on the campus security services like
lockers and security cameras instead of banning measures.
