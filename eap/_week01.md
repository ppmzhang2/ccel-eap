### Short Essay (30 minutes)

Read the following question and write a short essay of between 200 to 250 words
showing your ideas about the question.

Being a student is an important part of peopleâ€™s lives.
What are three advantages of being a student?
Use clear examples to help with your explanation.

When discussing the importance of schooling, most people think of compulsory
education as children of school age are obliged to receive primary education.
However, it is far from the only reason, or even the greatest.
There are three reasons people would choose to be a student.

Being a student can help secure well-paid jobs.
It is not easy to find a job by competing with dozen, if not hundreds, job
seekers.
Students who have developed practical skills and obtained qualifications
employers need have a better chance to stand out from other candidates to win
the post.

Although students may not expect to learn specific vocational skills in most
schools, they can develop critical thinking and problem solving capabilities.

Students on campus have more social interaction than those isolated in their
houses.

## Week 1-2

### Using coordinators to create compound sentences

1. Complete the text with the correct coordinators: and, but, and or.

**Rote learning**

Learning which does not necessitate understanding, **but** is undertaken
systematically **and** mechanistically, usually through repetition.
Examples might be the chanting of multiplication tables **or** the reciting of
passages learnt 'by heart' **but** with no accurate comprehension of content.
Such activities were an integral part of education in the 19th **and** early
20th centuries, **but** find little acceptance today.
To learn something by rote implies an intention to learn which is not present
when, for example, the lyrics of a song **or** the sequence of numbers for a
telephone call become committed to memory through repeated exposure **or**
frequent use.

> Oxford: Oxford University Press,

2. Compare your answers, saying why you selected a particular coordinator and
   how a different coordinator would change the meaning.
3. Tick the statements you think are true.
   1. The main coordinators in English are *and*, *but*, and *or*. (T)
   2. There are many other coordinators in English. (F)
   3. Coordinators can be removed from the sentence without changing the
      meaning. (F)
   4. Coordinators are frequently-used words, particularly *and*. (T)
   5. Coordinators normally join equal items, such as word + word (black and
      white), phrase + phrase (two problems but only one solution), and
      clause + clause (You could work on your essay or you could listen to a
      lecture online). (T)
   6. Coordinators are normally followed by a comma. (F)
   7. Beginning a sentence with a coordinator is considered to be informal
      style. (T)
   8. In academic writing, it is better to use words like *however* rather than
      coordinators such as *but*. (F)

### Writing

The director of your college has asked you to write a report on a visit you
made to a self-study centre at a local university.
You should explain how successful it has been and recommend whether or not your
college should have one.
Write your report to the director.
Write your answer in 250-280 words in an appropriate style.

- pros
  - People from the community use the facilities, which helps to fund it.
  - The worksheets provided give extra practice of classroom work.
  - The facility helps to attract potential students to the college.
- cons
  - It is under-used at weekends.
  - Many students still prefer to study in their own rooms
  - A full-time assistant has to be on duty even if the centre is empty.
  - It cost a lot to set up because of all the computers, etc.
  - Writing materials for the centre is time-consuming for the teachers.

Introduction

The aim of this report is to outline the advantages and potential problems of
investing money in a self-study centre for our college.
In order to do this, I have visited the self-study centre at Central English
University.

Advantages

There are several advantages of the facility at Central English University.
Firstly, it helps to attract potential students to the university.
Secondly, many students have also found the space and worksheets that are
provided very useful.

Disadvantages

The main disadvantage is the significant cost.
Despite many people from the community using the centre facilities, which helps
to fund it, it cost a significant amount to set up and there is also the cost
of having a full-time assistant on duty, even if the centre is empty.
In addition, writing materials for the centre is time-consuming for the
teachers.

Recommendations

Although there would be some students who would benefit from a self-study
centre, the significant costs of time and money would outweigh the advantages.
I would therefore recommend looking at other options.

Introduction

This report aims to outline the benefits and potential problems of constructing
a self-study center in XXX college, as well as to provide suggestions.
To achieve this purpose, this report includes a literature review of current
mainstream studies on self-learning and a survey of students both from and
outside the college.

Advantages

Self-study facilities can play an essential role in self-learning for students.
Zehra Unveren et al. (2008) proved by statistics that students who regularly
use self-study centers tend to perform better on tests.
Most respondents to the questionnaire also admitted that such a facility can
enable them to study at their own pace outside the class and that the resources
available in the center can be helpful for self-study.
Essentially, a self-study center is a valuable productivity tool for students.

Potential Problems

There are objections to investing in a self-study center, and the main concern
was raised from an economic perspective as its upkeep could be extravagant.
The total cost of such an extensive facility may include but is not limited to:

- labor cost for full-time assistants
- cost for equipment maintenance and upgrade
- prices of electricity, gas, water, et cetera

The necessity of a dedicated self-study facility was also questioned as it
could be under-used at weekends, and many students may still prefer to study in
their own rooms.

Recommendations

The self-study center may not pay its way at first.
However, with all things considered, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.
In addition, since this center will be open to the public, funds can be raised
from the surrounding communities to alleviate financial constraints.

## Week 1-3

### Reading

**Organic food: why?**

Today, many governments are promoting organic or natural farming methods that
avoid the use of pesticides and other artificial products.
The aim is to show that they care about the environment and about people's
health.
But is this the right approach?

A

Europe is now the biggest market for organic food in the world, expanding by 25
percent a year over the past 10 years.
So what is the attraction of organic food for some people?
The really important thing is that organic sounds more 'natural'.
Eating organic is a way of defining oneself as natural, good, caring, different
from the junk-food-scoffing masses.
As one journalist puts it:
'It feels closer to the source, the beginning, the start of things.'
The real desire is to be somehow close to the soil, to Mother Nature.

B

Unlike conventional farming, the organic approach means farming with natural,
rather than man-made, fertilisers and pesticides.
Techniques such as crop rotation improve soil quality and help organic farmers
compensate for the absence of man-made chemicals.
As a method of food production, organic is, however, inefficient in its use of
labour and land; there are severe limits to how much food can be produced.
Also, the environmental benefits of not using artificial fertiliser are tiny
compared with the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by transporting food
(a great deal of Britain's organic produce is shipped in from other countries
and transported from shop to home by car).

C

Organic farming is often claimed to be safer than conventional farming - for
the environment and for consumers.
Yet studies into organic farming worldwide continue to reject this claim.
An extensive review by the UK Food Standards Agency found that there was no
statistically significant difference between organic and conventional crops.
Even where results indicated there was evidence of a difference, the reviewers
found no sign that these differences would have an noticeable effect on health.

D

The simplistic claim that organic food is more nutritious than conventional
food was always likely to be misleading.
Food is a natural product, and the health value of different foods will vary
for a number of reasons, including freshness, the way the food is cooked, the
type of soil it is grown in, the amount of sunlight and rain crops have
received, and so on.
Likewise, the flavour of a carrot has less to do with whether it was fertilised
with manure or something out of a plastic sack than with the variety of carrot
and how long ago it was dug up.
The differences created by these things are likely to be greater than any
differences brought about by using an organic or non-organic system of
production.
Indeed, even some 'organic' farms are quite different from one another.

E

The notion that organic food is safer than 'normal' food is also contradicted
by the fact that many of our most common foods are full of natural toxins.
Parsnips cause blisters on the skin of agricultural workers.
Toasting bread creates carcinogens.
As one research expert says:
'People think that the more natural something is, the better it is for them.
That is simply not the case.
In fact, it is the opposite that is true:
the closer a plant is to its natural state, the more likely it is that it will
poison you.
Naturally, many plants do not want to be eaten, so we have spent 10,000 years
developing agriculture and breeding out harmful traits from crops.'

F

Yet educated Europeans are more scared of eating traces of a few, strictly
regulated, man-made chemicals than they are of eating the ones that nature
created directly.
Surrounded by plentiful food, it's not nature they worry about, but technology.
Our obsessions with the ethics and safety of what we eat - concerns about
antibiotics in animals, additives in food, GM crops and so on - are symptomatic
of a highly technological society that has little faith in its ability to use
this technology wisely.
In this context, the less something is touched by the human hand, the healthier
people assume it must be.

G

Ultimately, the organic farming movement is an expensive luxury for shoppers in
well-manicured Europe.
For developing parts of the world, it is irrelevant.
To European environmentalists, the fact that organic methods require more
labour and land than conventional ones to get the same yields is a good thing;
to a farmer in rural Africa, it is a disaster.
Here, land tends to be so starved and crop yields so low that there simply is
not enough organic matter to put back into the soil.
Perhaps the focus should be on helping these countries to gain access to the
most advanced farming techniques, rather than going back to basics.
