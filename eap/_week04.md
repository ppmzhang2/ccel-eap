## Week 4-2

### Live Writing Practice Task: Introductions

Make a plan for this 1000 word essay.
Then write an introduction ONLY of 100 - 120 words.

> Some people say that because many people are living much longer, the age at
> which people retire should be raised considerably.
> To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Changing the retirement age has not been a popular subject of study until
recently.
With medical improvement comes an increase in typical longevity, and
increasingly more experienced employees have decided to delay retirement.

Raising the retirement age can impact almost all aspects of society, including
financial revenue and the employment rate, and deserves comprehensive research.
This essay will focus on the impact on the financial balance sheet if the
retirement age is raised, before moving on to assess both the positive and the
negative effects on employment, especially for young people.

## Week 4-3

### Essay Introduction

1. Hook: introduces the topic and gets interest
   - The aging of the population has become more serious, and delaying
     retirement has become a trend in the international world.
   - For people born after 2010, retirement could be a luxury of their
     grandfathers.
2. Background: gives context of the topic to the reader
   - In recent years, in order to reduce government spending, the world has
     been talking about delaying retirement.
   - People are living a better life than ever before and the average life
     expectancy of humans has increased. Therefore, some people think the
     retirement age needs to increase as well.
3. Rationale: explains why you are writing about this
   - It is important to investigate the idea, not only for individuals but also
     for the whole society.
   - Delaying retirement could solve the government's financial crisis, but its
     negative issues cannot be neglected.
4. Thesis statement: tells the reader what your main points are and what
   order - like our sub themes for presentations
   - In this essay, I will consider how raising the retirement age can cause
     mental and physical pressure for elderly people, then focus on the
     difference of work efficiency between young and old people, and finally
     discuss the benefits of retiring early.
   - This essay will focus firstly on how raising the retirement age may put
     pressure on the health of the elderly, and then examines the impact on
     younger employees.

### Reading

**Out of Africa: solar energy from the Sahara**

Vivienne Walt reports on ho the Sahara Desert could offer a truly green
solution to Europe's energy problems

- A. For years, the Sahara has been regarded by many Europeans as a terra
  incognita[^f_w04_3_1_] of little economic value or importance.
  But this idea may soon change completely.
  Politicians and scientists on both sides of the Mediterranean are beginning
  to focus on the Sahara's potential to provide power for Europe in the future.
  They believe the desert's true value comes from the fact that it is dry and
  empty.
  Some areas of the Sahara reach 45 degrees centigrade on many afternoons.
  It is, in other words, a gigantic natural storehouse of solar energy.

- B. A few years ago, scientists began to calculate just how much energy the
  Sahara holds.
  They were astonished at the answer.
  In theory, a 90,600 square kilometre chunk of the Sahara - smaller than
  Portugal and a little over 1% of its total area - could yield the same amount
  of electricity as all the world's power plants combined.
  A smaller square of 15,500 square kilometres - about the size of
  Connecticut - could provide electricity for Europe's 500 million people.
  'I admit I was sceptical until I did the calculations myself,'
  says Michael Pawlyn, director of Exploration Architecture, one of three
  British environmental companies comprising the Sahara Forest Project, which
  is testing solar plants in Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
  Pawlyn calls the Sahara's potential 'staggering'.

- C. At the moment, no one is proposing the creation of a solar power station
  the size of a small country.
  But a relatively well-developed technology exists, which proponents say could
  turn the Sahara's heat and sunlight into a major source of electricity -
  Concentrating Solar Power (CSP).
  Unlike solar panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity, CSP
  utilises mirrors which focus light on water pipes or boilers to produce very
  hot steam to operate the turbines of generators.
  Small CSP plants have produced power in California's Mojave Desert since the
  1980s.
  The Sahara Forest Project proposes building CSP plants in areas below sea
  level (the Sahara has several such depressions) so that sea water can flow
  into them.
  This water would then be purified and used for powering turbines and washing
  dust off the mirrors.
  Waste water would then supply irrigation to areas around the stations,
  creating lush oases - hence the 'forest' in the group's name.

- D. But producing significant quantities of electricity means building huge
  arrays of mirrors and pipes across hundreds of miles of remote desert, which
  is expensive.
  Gerry Wolff, an engineer who heads DESERTEC, an international consortium of
  solar-power scientists, says they have estimated it will cost about $59
  billion to begin transmitting power from the Sahara by 2020.

- E. Building plants is just part of the challenge.
  One of the drawbacks to CSP technology is that it works at maximum efficiency
  only in sunny, hot climates - and deserts tend to be distant from population
  centres.
  To supply Europe with 20% of its electricity needs, more than 19,300
  kilometres of cables would need to be laid under the Mediterranean, says
  Gunnar Asplund, head of HVDC research at ABB Power Technologies in Ludvika,
  Sweden.
  Indeed, to use renewable sources of power, including solar, wind and tidal,
  Europe will need to build completely new electrical grids.
  That's because existing infrastructures, built largely for the coal-fired
  plants that supply 80% of Europe's power, would not be suitable for carrying
  the amount of electricity generated by the Sahara.
  Germany's government-run Aerospace Centre, which researches energy, estimates
  that replacing those lines could raise the cost of building solar plants in
  the Sahara and sending significant amounts of power to Europe to about $465
  billion over the next 40 years.
  Generous government subsidies will be needed.
  'Of course it costs a lot of money,' says Asplund.
  'It's a lot cheaper to burn coal than to make solar power in the Sahara!'

- F. Meanwhile, some companies are getting started.
  Seville engineering company Abengoa is building one solar-thermal plant in
  Algeria and another in Morocco, while a third is being built in Egypt by a
  Spanish-Japanese joint venture.
  The next step will be to get cables in place.
  Although the European Parliament has passed a law that aids investors who
  help the continent reach its goal of getting 20% of its power from renewable
  energy by 2020, it could take years to create the necessary infrastructure.

- G. Nicholas Dunlop, secretary-general of the London-based NGO e-Parliament,
  thinks companies should begin transmitting small amounts of solar power as
  soon as the North African plants begin operating, by linking a few cable
  lines under the Med.
  'I call it the Lego method,' he says.
  'Build it piece by piece.'
  If it can be shown that power from the Sahara can be produced profitably, he
  says, companies and governments will soon jump in.
  If they do, perhaps airplane passengers flying across the Sahara will one day
  count the mirrors and patches of green instead of staring at sand.

It is widely acknowledged that every year many young people enter higher
education for monetary purposes, as the positive correlation between a college
degree and a "good job", that is to say, a post with a considerable salary, is
unmistakable.
However, the reason behind the correlation is still largely undetermined.
It is essential, academically and ethically, to evaluate how a college degree
is related to its holder's income status, as the findings can help improve
people's employability and correct any potential salary bias due to
education-based discrimination.
This essay will first assess the influence of degrees on the possibility of
successful job seeking, before comparing the overall performance and feedback
from employers among employees of different degree levels, including people
without a degree.
Finally, this essay will discuss the ethical issues concerning discrimination
based on educational background.

## Week 4-4

### Live Writing Task

> It would be much easier for everyone if all countries used the same legal
> system.
>
> To what extent do you agree with this statement?

Friedrich Hayek
(1899 - 1992, Austrian economist, legal theorist and philosopher)
believed that intellectuals can hardly resist the temptation of any kind of
unification theory thanks to their conceit, and it seems the world is proving
him right as some self-proclaimed scholars are promoting their new era
unification hypothesis, that is, to apply to the whole world a single legal
system.
It is essential, both academically and ethically, to point out their errors, as
this proposition erodes the very basis of the common law system and could
inevitably lead to a totalitarian superstate, or Hobbes's Leviathan, which
every righteous mind should take a stand against.
This essay will first examine the conventional differences of different
regions, which is the main origin of all contemporary law systems, before
moving on to discuss the ethical issues of the loss of legal diversity
concerning the infringement of states' rights and the potential danger of
totalitarianism.

### Report Writing 1

An international research groups calling out an investigation into housing
situation for young people around the world.
You have been asked by the group to write a report about your country,
including the following points:

- the different housing options available in your country for young people in
  their early 20s
- the problems faced by young people with each option
- possible future changes in the housing situation for young people in your
  country

**The housing situation for young people in my country**

**Introduction**

The aim of this report is to examine the various housing options open to people
in their early 20s in my country and the difficulties encountered with each
one.
It will also consider likely future developments in the housing situation for
young people here.

**Buying a property**

Property speculation and soaring inflation have put house prices beyond the
reach of the majority of first-time buyers.
The few who do manage to raise the money for the deposit on a small flat, are
likely to experience problems obtaining a mortgage.
Banks are unwilling to lend money to anyone without a permanent contract,
something which most young workers can only dream of.

**Renting**

An obvious alternative is to rent a property. However, rents, like house
prices, A have risen dramatically, forcing low-earners to share.
For many 20-somethings this can prove an enjoyable experience, but some soon
discover that they are not suited to living with others.
Local authorities provide some low-cost rented accommodation specifically for
young single people, but this tends to be in very short supply.

**Living with parents**

It is hardly surprising, then, that a significant proportion of school and
college leavers opt to continue living in the parental home until they have
saved enough money to buy a place of their own.
This may take some time, however, and friction between parents and children can
result.

**Future developments**

As long as house prices continue to increase, the outlook for young people here
will remain bleak. Only a substantial fall in property values will improve the
situation and this seems unlikely in the near
future.

### Report Writing 2

An international research group is carrying out an investigation into
employment prospects for young people around the world.
You have been asked by the group to write a report about your local area,
including the following points:

- the types of employment available for young people in your area
- the difficulties faced by young people searching for work
- possible future developments in the employment situation for young people in
  your area

Write your report in 220-260 words.

### Presentation

Before we get started, I would like to share a classic scene from Quentin
Tarantino's Inglorious Bastard, in which an Ally spy gave himself away simply
by making an incorrect counting gesture.
Without giving too much away, this spy, disguised as an SS Hauptsturmführer,
ordered a final round of whiskey, telling the bartender "Drei Gläser" and
holding three fingers up — his index, middle, and ring finger.
This **extremely** subtle mistake, which many people did not even notice then,
insinuated that he was actually an undercover agent and eventually cost his
life in the subsequent basement firefight.

This leads to the topic we will discuss today:
finger counting - or, to be more precise, dactylonomy.
We will first look at some linear finger-counting systems before exploring more
complicated ones.

Let's start by looking at the most commonly used dactylonomy worldwide:
the linear.
Linear finger-counting varies among cultures.
However, in western Europe, there is a **highly** good chance that people will
start counting with their thumbs.
With this convention, the thumb is always the first digit representing the
number one, followed by the index finger (number two), middle finger (number
three), ring finger (number four), and finally, the pinky finger (number five).
While in countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom,
people typically count with the index finger as the first digit and end with
the thumb representing the number five.
In parts of the middle east like Iran, the counting usually starts with the
picky.
In an exceptional case, the Japanese start counting with the fingers extended
in an open palm, drawing them in to make a closed fist.
These counting methods mentioned, however different they seem, share the basic
rule of adding a new finger for each additional one.
Each of them usually has a unique one-to-one correspondence between numbers
from one to five and each finger.
For example, an index finger is always considered number one for an American
yet denotes number two in most European countries.
As a result, if you were to hold up an index finger to a German bartender to
represent one, he might misunderstand and think you meant two.

Let us move on to another category of finger counting, especially ubiquitous in
China.
This dactylonomy counts from one to five the same way as in the US, yet after
six, it keeps tracking on the same hand, using symbols instead of finger
quantities to represent different numbers from six to ten.
This symbolic system is perfectly convenient since it uses only one hand.
Yet it is not so intuitive to learn, and people usually need time to master it.

However, even the Chinese symbolic system does not solve the main limitation of
the usual linear counting methods:
numbers greater than ten cannot be represented.
This leads to our final part:
the multi-dimensional system.
During their long-time trading practice, some merchants in India developed an
**extraordinarily** ingenious counting method.
They often use the left hand to count up to five, whereas the right hand keeps
track of how many fives have been counted, representing the multiples of five.
By adding a new dimension, this dactylonomy expands the maximum number
representable to 30.
Some other variance of this two-dimensional counting method can even represent
numbers up to a staggering 400 using the lines between the segments of the
fingers.

That's all for today.
Thank you very much for listening.
I will be happy to answer if any one has any questions.
