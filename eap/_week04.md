### Live Writing Practice Task: Introductions

Make a plan for this 1000 word essay.
Then write an introduction ONLY of 100 - 120 words.

> Some people say that because many people are living much longer, the age at
> which people retire should be raised considerably.
> To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Changing the retirement age has not been a popular subject of study until
recently.
With medical improvement comes an increase in typical longevity, and
increasingly more experienced employees have decided to delay retirement.

Raising the retirement age can impact almost all aspects of society, including
financial revenue and the employment rate, and deserves comprehensive research.
This essay will focus on the impact on the financial balance sheet if the
retirement age is raised, before moving on to assess both the positive and the
negative effects on employment, especially for young people.

**Out of Africa: solar energy from the Sahara**

Vivienne Walt reports on ho the Sahara Desert could offer a truly green
solution to Europe's energy problems

- A. For years, the Sahara has been regarded by many Europeans as a terra
  incognita[^f_w04_3_1_] of little economic value or importance.
  But this idea may soon change completely.
  Politicians and scientists on both sides of the Mediterranean are beginning
  to focus on the Sahara's potential to provide power for Europe in the future.
  They believe the desert's true value comes from the fact that it is dry and
  empty.
  Some areas of the Sahara reach 45 degrees centigrade on many afternoons.
  It is, in other words, a gigantic natural storehouse of solar energy.

- B. A few years ago, scientists began to calculate just how much energy the
  Sahara holds.
  They were astonished at the answer.
  In theory, a 90,600 square kilometre chunk of the Sahara - smaller than
  Portugal and a little over 1% of its total area - could yield the same amount
  of electricity as all the world's power plants combined.
  A smaller square of 15,500 square kilometres - about the size of
  Connecticut - could provide electricity for Europe's 500 million people.
  'I admit I was sceptical until I did the calculations myself,'
  says Michael Pawlyn, director of Exploration Architecture, one of three
  British environmental companies comprising the Sahara Forest Project, which
  is testing solar plants in Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
  Pawlyn calls the Sahara's potential 'staggering'.

- C. At the moment, no one is proposing the creation of a solar power station
  the size of a small country.
  But a relatively well-developed technology exists, which proponents say could
  turn the Sahara's heat and sunlight into a major source of electricity -
  Concentrating Solar Power (CSP).
  Unlike solar panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity, CSP
  utilises mirrors which focus light on water pipes or boilers to produce very
  hot steam to operate the turbines of generators.
  Small CSP plants have produced power in California's Mojave Desert since the
  1980s.
  The Sahara Forest Project proposes building CSP plants in areas below sea
  level (the Sahara has several such depressions) so that sea water can flow
  into them.
  This water would then be purified and used for powering turbines and washing
  dust off the mirrors.
  Waste water would then supply irrigation to areas around the stations,
  creating lush oases - hence the 'forest' in the group's name.

- D. But producing significant quantities of electricity means building huge
  arrays of mirrors and pipes across hundreds of miles of remote desert, which
  is expensive.
  Gerry Wolff, an engineer who heads DESERTEC, an international consortium of
  solar-power scientists, says they have estimated it will cost about $59
  billion to begin transmitting power from the Sahara by 2020.

- E. Building plants is just part of the challenge.
  One of the drawbacks to CSP technology is that it works at maximum efficiency
  only in sunny, hot climates - and deserts tend to be distant from population
  centres.
  To supply Europe with 20% of its electricity needs, more than 19,300
  kilometres of cables would need to be laid under the Mediterranean, says
  Gunnar Asplund, head of HVDC research at ABB Power Technologies in Ludvika,
  Sweden.
  Indeed, to use renewable sources of power, including solar, wind and tidal,
  Europe will need to build completely new electrical grids.
  That's because existing infrastructures, built largely for the coal-fired
  plants that supply 80% of Europe's power, would not be suitable for carrying
  the amount of electricity generated by the Sahara.
  Germany's government-run Aerospace Centre, which researches energy, estimates
  that replacing those lines could raise the cost of building solar plants in
  the Sahara and sending significant amounts of power to Europe to about $465
  billion over the next 40 years.
  Generous government subsidies will be needed.
  'Of course it costs a lot of money,' says Asplund.
  'It's a lot cheaper to burn coal than to make solar power in the Sahara!'

- F. Meanwhile, some companies are getting started.
  Seville engineering company Abengoa is building one solar-thermal plant in
  Algeria and another in Morocco, while a third is being built in Egypt by a
  Spanish-Japanese joint venture.
  The next step will be to get cables in place.
  Although the European Parliament has passed a law that aids investors who
  help the continent reach its goal of getting 20% of its power from renewable
  energy by 2020, it could take years to create the necessary infrastructure.

- G. Nicholas Dunlop, secretary-general of the London-based NGO e-Parliament,
  thinks companies should begin transmitting small amounts of solar power as
  soon as the North African plants begin operating, by linking a few cable
  lines under the Med.
  'I call it the Lego method,' he says.
  'Build it piece by piece.'
  If it can be shown that power from the Sahara can be produced profitably, he
  says, companies and governments will soon jump in.
  If they do, perhaps airplane passengers flying across the Sahara will one day
  count the mirrors and patches of green instead of staring at sand.

Questions 10-13

Complete the summary below.
Choose **NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS** from passage for each answer.

Concentrating Solar Power (CSP)

Unlike solar panels, CSP concentrates the sun's energy on boilers by using
**mirrors**.
The resulting produces high-temperature **steam**, which turn moves the
turbines which generate electric CSP plants will be situated in **depressions**
to let sea water to run in.
This, when purified, can be to wash the equipment.
The resulting dirty water be used for **irrigation** around the power plant and
in this way oases will be formed.
