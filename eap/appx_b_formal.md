# Appendix B: Formal and Informal

What is the difference between formal and informal language?

Formal and informal language serve different purposes.
The tone, the choice of words and the way the words are put together vary
between the two styles.
Formal language is less personal than informal language.
It is used when writing for professional or academic purposes like university
assignments.
Formal language does not use colloquialisms, contractions or first person
pronouns such as 'I' or 'We'.
Informal language is more casual and spontaneous.
It is used when communicating with friends or family either in writing or in
conversation.
It is used when writing personal emails, text messages and in some business
correspondence.
The tone of informal language is more personal than formal language.

The first time an acronym or initialism is used in an essay, it is acceptable
to write the name in full with the acronym or initialism in brackets after it.
Every subsequent time it is used the acronym or initialism can be used on its
own.
Commonly known acronyms such as ANZAC and QANTAS do not need to be written in
full.

If an acronym or initialism needs to be made into a plural, add a small 's' to
it without an apostrophe.
