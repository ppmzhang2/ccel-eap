## Week 5-3

**Conclusions**

1. Need to reference the topic / task, thesis statement, main ideas and give a
   summary of main points.
2. Can also include:
   - suggestions, comments, or recommendations for the future
   - a reference to research, a reference to findings or results
   - a statement of limitations
3. should NOT include new ideas not covered in the rest of the essay

## Week 5-4

### Conclusion Writing

Overall, the potential risk of a superstate-style legal framework unification
cannot be underestimated due to cultural differences between nations.
Although this essay cannot cover all related aspects, it is evident, either by
reasoning or by consulting judicial practice, that severe issues may arise if a
spontaneous legal system were forced to follow arbitrary standards.
More studies will be needed to examine the impacts of the diversity of the legal system.

(What does 'a spontaneous legal system' mean?
Also, since you seem to be very strongly against a single legal system, it may
make more sense for you to end with a final recommendation about not having
one, or a finding why it is so terrible.
Does that make sense?
It will just strengthen your argument more than your final sentence now.)

### Discussion Essay

> Many people tout the electric vehicle as the solution to traffic induced
> pollution.
> Others argue that there are significant drawbacks to electric vehicles.
> Discuss and conclude with your own opinion
>
> You should write between 280 and 370 words.

That the electric cars are becoming yearly more numerous is a bright promise
for fanatic environmentalists who have already wholeheartedly embraced
renewable energy, yet an entertaining paradox for the skeptics.
It is essential to evaluate both the advantages of electric vehicles compared
with gas-powered vehicles and the detrimental effects of this still-emerging
technology, as this drastic shift in the automobile industry could shape the
future in a far broader scope.
This essay will first evaluate the emission reduction effect of electric cars,
before discussing its disadvantages in battery production and mining.

The exhaust release from an electric car is enormously lower than a
conventional fuel-powered auto.
An electric vehicle has no tailpipe, meaning its direct air pollution is none.
In terms of carbon footprint, an electric vehicle is also believed to be
responsible for a lower level of greenhouse gas release than its gasoline or
diesel counterpart, considering the electricity consumption sourced by power
plants.

(It could have one more sentence at least.
It’s just a little short in terms of a body paragraph.
If you have just one main point, you should have at least 2-3 sentences of
decent length.
Sentence 2 here is quite short so you’re going to need another sentence to
develop it fully.)

The brave new world of zero-emission, touted by electric vehicle advocates, is
significantly questionable considering the battery-producing and mining
process.
Additional energy is required before an electric car can roll off the
production line, mainly for its energy storage device.
In addition, unlike conventional gasoline or diesel engines, the manufacturing
of electric motors requires much more minerals, which can negatively affect the
environment by boosting more mines.

(You could use a little more development here.
You have enough words to write more, so you don’t need to worry about writing
too many words by adding another sentence or half a sentence to explain or give
examples.)

To conclude, electric power for vehicles is an essential technological leap
forward in reducing direct traffic induced pollution, yet its hidden risks
cannot be underestimated from a full-cycle perspective.
Whether or not this transition towards electricity is a truly desirable
solution to traffic-related issues is best left unsaid before more studies are
performed in this field.

(Since the task asked us to conclude with our own opinion, meaning choose one
side or the other, it isn’t really clear enough to me which side you are on.
I can guess you’re leaning towards it has more drawbacks because of the 'yet'
in sentence one, but you need at least one more sentence with some clear
stance for it to be clear 100% for me.
I’m left a bit uncertain.)
