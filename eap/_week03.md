### Presentation

**Plagiarism**

I am delighted to be here today to share with you my understanding of
plagiarism.
I have divided the presentation into two parts.
In the first part, I will talk about the definition of plagiarism;
then, in the second part, I'll explain why it is undesirable.

Let's start by looking at what plagiarism is.
Plagiarism is about stealing intellectual property such as thoughts or ideas.
It is not limited to copying your classmate's answer sheet.
Any representation of other people's work as your original one will be deemed
as misconduct.

This leads to the second part:
why you should avoid plagiarism.
You don't want academic plagiarism because it will hurt yourself, not anyone
else.
Attending educational activities such as courses and programs is not merely a
way to acquire specific domain knowledge but also a path to constructing
learning patterns.
Continual misconduct within this process will take effect slowly but steadily
to distort one's way of learning.
When some poor devil accustomed to academic dishonesty finally gets into the
habit of cutting corners, he will probably be doomed to forfeit his creativity
as he has already lost his innovative motivation.
Even if some "lucky" guy can graduate from college by conducting a long series
of successful academic cheating, he will inevitably realize his incompetence
when taking on a job.
This could be the beginning of a life-long tragedy as someone condemns himself
to a career he does not know how to do or, even worse, does not like at all.

That's all for today. Thank you very much for listening.
