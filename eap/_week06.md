Conclusion Examples

- In conclusion, **although** electric vehicles **can** help reduce greenhouse
  gas, which is good for the environment, they **certainly** have
  **significant** drawbacks discouraging people use them for the inconvenience.
  **Indeed**, an electric car **could not** be suitable for individual use at
  this time.
  If governments would like to address the air pollution problem, they should
  consider **other solutions**.
- The discussion has shown that electric vehicles **may** have some battery
  and contamination issues.
  **Nevertheless**, it **certainly** eases resource consumption and makes a
  non-negligible contribution to environmental protection.
  We have considered most factors, but it has not been possible to cover all of
  the causes.
  **What is clear**, however, the society that environmental protection has
  become the mainstream topic, with the improvement of batteries and the
  popularization of charging piles, the popularity of electric vehicles will
  become **inevitable**.

### Discussion Essay

> Some people arque that it is necessary for economic growth, while others
> claim that it damages local industries.
> Discuss both views and give your opinion.
>
> You should write between 280 and 370 words.

Doubts about the free movement of global goods, so long been settled since the
rise of the British empire in the 19th century, have unexpectedly sparked
another round of debates in a new era of trade war rivalry.
It is essential to dispel the increasing concerns about trade freedom, which is
the very basis of the global economy so deeply integrated into each country’s
society worldwide.
The essay will first demonstrate a common misleading view on free international
trade before reemphasizing the win-win scenario, which is the underlying effect
of commerce.

(This 1st part of your thesis statement is more like an argument essay than a
discussion essay.
If the task is to 'discuss' we have to look at both sides evenly with a more
objective view.
Obviously we can lean towards one side or the other with stance, but we can’t
argue a side yet until the conclusion)

The concern that not fully developed local firms could be crushed when
competing with global giants, though convinced by many people, does not survive
a thorough assessment of recent commercial activities.
By participating in global business, local companies are granted chances to
learn from multinational enterprises advanced manufacturing skills and
management methods.
Moreover, trading within the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework is
ensured against unfair competition via compliant processes.
Taking part in the global contest is an opportunity to thrive for ambitious
entrepreneurs rather than a challenge.

International merchandising is not a zero-sum game as protectionists believe.
Indeed, manufacturers can earn additional revenue by exporting goods to another
country.
It is equally undeniable that local consumers can enjoy high-quality foreign
products at a lower price than domestic ones by allowing unrestricted
importation.
Each participant benefits from the freedom of trade as long as the movement of
goods is not blocked by heavy tariffs or other barriers.

(The problem with these 2 body paragraphs is that you’ve written both about the
positives of international trade.
This is not what the task asked for as it is a discussion essay, not an
argument essay.
So you need to turn one of these paragraphs into the side of international
trade not being good for local businesses, even if you disagree with this idea.
This is what a discussion essay is.)

Overall, the free movement of goods across national borders should be regarded
as the rule rather than the exception during contemporary economic exchanges.
Although it is impossible to cover each aspect, so much is certain: the
transition from protectionism to liberalism, which has been carried out over
the last two centuries, is irreversible.

(This is a good conclusion but I’d add one more positive adjective after
irreversible to show you think it is a good thing not just an irreversible one,
which can often be a negative idea)

## Week 6-5

### Proposal Writing

Your class is going to write a proposal for the ideal workplace of the future.
Write your proposal, identifying the main issues that should be considered and
proposing the ideal workplace of the future, with reasons.

Write your proposal in 240-260 words.

**Introduction**

Many people have problems with their workplace.
We were asked to write a proposal for an ideal workplace that would address
these issues.
We undertook research through a survey and research on the Internet.

**Background information**

It is clear that many people dislike noise, preferring to work in a quiet
environment, where it's impossible to hear others speaking.
The phone is a particular issue here.
Others like to feel that they are part of a team, and need people around them
to maintain their motivation.
Some dislike small offices, finding them claustrophobic.
Everyone must feel comfortable, and not have concerns over issues such as meal
breaks.

**Suggestions for the ideal workplace of the future**

The ideal workplace should have four key features.

- It should be light and airy, and have space between desks so that people
  feel comfortable
- There should be ample opportunity for people more around, and to have drinks
  and food at any time - not only in designated lunch and coffee breaks
- There should be a sense of team spirit so no-one is demotivated

**Conclusion**

The ideal workplace is not a fantasy - if recommendations like these are
followed through it can become reality.

**Introduction**

The aim of this proposal is to examine the ideal workplace of the future.
In order to do this, workers were surveyed.

Current workplace situation

Nowadays, almost all the workers have been becoming the multiple taskers who
need to handle a variety of tasks in work and family.
Because of the fixing working hours and location, they seem barely to be able
to achieve it, which brings extra pressure and anxiety in their daily work.
Additionally, many people do not cope well with temperatures and noises,
preferring to work in a comfortable and quite environment, where it is
impossible to feel too hot or too cold and hear others speaking on their phone.
Furthermore, others do not feel belonging and motivated in their workplace.

Suggestions and reasons for the ideal workplace of the future

The ideal workplace should have these three main features:

- It should have a flexible working time and location.
  Without limitation of working hours and locations, the staff can prioritize
  and balance their work and personal life based on daily schedules, the
  flexibility provides options for workers who are able to work in office,
  home, coffee shops at any suitable time.
  It is important because the flexibility supports workers to achieve their
  success of professional life and personal life in today’s modern world.
- It should have quality facilities to offer a comfortable working environment.
  Such as having superior temperature comfort in workplace, private rooms for
  calls.
  It is a strongly recommend as workers may not concentrate well in an
  uncomfortable working environment, and noise is the key cause of distraction.
- There should be a friendly working environment, which is maintaining caring
  and motivating.
  People become far more productive while they feel belonging in the company.

**Conclusion**

Workers are the central resource in the company, they create the profitable
performances for the company. Therefore, the ideal workplace is necessary and
important for someone who value the company, and it will be reality if these
recommendations been followed.
